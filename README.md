# Data_Hazards_workshops

## Welcome!
Hello, and welcome to the materials I use to give workshops on Data Hazards. 
This is where I will be adding the materials I use for various workshops I run. They all follow pretty much the same patter but have slightly different tweaks depending on whether they are run as a hybrid, online or in-person.

Please find more information on Data Hazards [here](https://github.com/Susana465/Data_Hazards_workshop_COMBINE).

Or if you're not too comfortable with github, have a browse at the [website](https://datahazards.com) for more info.
